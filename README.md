# flights
Here in my code I solved the following problems:
 
-How are the flights delays by Airlines/Airports/States/Routes?
-Which Airlines/Airports/States/Routes have the most delays? (In terms of the number and time span of delay)
-How many flights arrive on time or earlier?
-Can flight delays be accurately predicted with machine learning?
-How long is the most common delay, how is the time of delay distributed?
-Are there higher delays for airports situated closer to the Northeast of US?
-Merge the data with weather information 
-With discrete features(Airline/Airport/Route...) and continuous features(Departure_Hour/_Date/_Latitude/_Longitude/_temperature/_wind...), applying Random Forest to predict the departure delay 
-Flight routes visualization on a US map
