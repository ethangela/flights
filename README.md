# Flights
Here in my code I solved the following problems:
 
- How are the flights delays by Airlines/Airports/States/Routes?

2) Which Airlines/Airports/States/Routes have the most delays? (In terms of the number and time span of delay)

3) How many flights arrive on time or earlier?

4) Can flight delays be accurately predicted with machine learning?

5) How long is the most common delay, how is the time of delay distributed?

6) Are there higher delays for airports situated closer to the Northeast of US?

7) Merge the data with weather information 

8) With discrete features(Airline/Airport/Route...) and continuous features(Departure_Hour/_Date/_Latitude/_Longitude/_temperature/_wind...), applying Random Forest to predict the departure delay 

9) Flight routes visualization on a US map
